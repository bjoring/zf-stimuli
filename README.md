# zf-stimuli
This is a collection of stimuli used for behavioral experiments. The `calibration` folder contains white noise stimuli at a variety of decibel levels that can be used to calibrate the sound levels of speakers. The `ar-gng` folder contains stimulus sets of zebra finch song which have been modified to induce the illusion of auditory restoration of a deleted note in the songs.
